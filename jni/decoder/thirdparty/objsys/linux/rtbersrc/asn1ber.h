 * @mainpage ASN1C BER/DER Runtime Classes and Library Functions
 *
 * The <B>ASN.1 C++ Runtime Classes</B> are wrapper classes that provide
 * an object-oriented interface to the ASN.1 C runtime library functions.
 * The classes described in this manual are derived from the common
 * classes documented in the ASN1C C/C++ Common Runtime manual.
 * They are specific to the Basic Encoding Rules (BER) and Distinguished
 * Encoding Rules (DER) as defined in the ITU-T X.690 standard.
 *
 * These BER/DER specific C++ runtime classes include:
 * <UL> <LI>classes for streaming BER/DER decoding </LI><LI>classes for
 * streaming BER/DER encoding.</LI></UL>
 *
 *
 * The <B> ASN.1 BER Runtime Library</B> contains all of the
 * low-level constants, types, and functions that are assembled by the compiler
 * to encode/decode more complex structures.
 *
 * This library consists of the following two items:
 *   <UL> <LI>A global include file ("asn1ber.h") that is compiled into all
 * generated source files.</LI>
 *<LI> An object library of functions that are linked with the C functions
 * after compilation with a C complier.</LI></UL>
 *
 * In general, programmers will not need to be too concerned with the details
 * of these functions. The ASN.1 compiler generates calls to them in the C or
 * C++ source files that it creates. However, the functions in the library may
 * also be called on their own in applications requiring their specific
 * functionality.

 *   -# Call the xd_setp low-level decode function to specify the address of
 * the buffer containing the encoded ASN.1 data to be decoded.
 *   -# Call the specific decode function to decode the value. The tag value
 * obtained in the first step can be used to determine which decode function to
