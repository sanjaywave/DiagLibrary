/**
 * @mainpage ASN1C XER Runtime Classes and Library Functions
 *
 * The <B>ASN.1 C++ runtime classes</B> are wrapper classes that provide
 * an object-oriented interface to the ASN.1 C Runtime Library functions.
 * The classes described in this manual are derived from the common
 * classes documented in the ASN1C C/C++ Common Runtime manual.
 * They are specific to the XML Encoding Rules (XER)as defined in
 * the X.693 ITU-T  standard.
 *
 * These XER specific C++ runtime classes include:
 * <UL> <LI>classes for streaming XER decoding </LI><LI>classes for
 * streaming XER encoding.</LI></UL>
 *
 * The <B> ASN.1 XER Runtime Library</B> contains the low-level
 * constants, types, and functions that are assembled by the compiler
 * to encode/decode more complex structures.
 *
 * This library consists of the following items:
 *   <UL> <LI>A global include file ("asn1xer.h") that is compiled into all
 * generated source files.</LI>
 *<LI> An object library of functions that are linked with the C functions
 * after compilation with a C complier.</LI></UL>
 *
 * In general, programmers will not need to be too concerned with the details
 * of these functions. The ASN.1 compiler generates calls to them in the C or
 * C++ source files that it creates. However, the functions in the library may
 * also be called on their own in applications requiring their specific
 * functionality.
